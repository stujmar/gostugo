                <li>The Project: <span class="project-bullet">Timms Valley was an Stopmotion animation tv pilot for IFC.</span></li>
                <li>My Role: <span class="project-bullet">I played three major roles, breaking down animation in preproduction to fabrication rigs and solutions for each shot. Fabricating props and machining puppet armatures, then during production I was the director of animation managing 5 animation stages.</span></li>
                <li>Take Aways: <span class="project-bullet">I learned a lot about narative television production and even more about stopmotion animation and fabrcation, as well as managing teams of people. A big take away of this was that I didn't want to have anything to do with the film union or their heirarchies, dogmas, or egos. It made me rethink what "having made it" in my career was. This was when I really stopped trying to climb some ladder of film/television networking and went and started my own company Edgewater Workbench</span></li>
