                <li>The Project: <span class="project-bullet">I was tasked with designing a bike rack to be installed in Edgewater, the most densly populated residential neighborhood in chicago.</span></li>
                <li>My Role: <span class="project-bullet">This was an entirely solo project that I completed independently from start to finish. I had never designed anything this larger or functional before. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, pun intended. I had seen some off the wall proposed designs that had inspired me to throw my own hat in the ring. I went around to other neightborhoods that had never bike rick design and tooki measurement. I didn't want to have a lot of back and forth with the chamber of commerce on functionality so I just matched height and width of existing design and incorporated Edgewater's logo.</span></li>
                <li>Take Aways: <span class="project-bullet"> I learned it pays to do your research ahead of time and to sometimes play it safe. The bike racks will be a fixture of the city for decades to come.</span></li>
