                <li>The Project: <span class="project-bullet">Starting in 2009 I began recording location audio for film production.</span></li>
                <li>My Role: <span class="project-bullet">I began doing small low stakes projects for fun in film school. There was a slow snowballing over the next 10 years where I began getting larger jobs dealing with more advanced equipment and having more responsibility.
                    Over the years I worked on news crews for every major network. Did a feature length documentary in South Africa. Was a day player on true crime for Investigation Discovery. Set up a complex system of hidden mics for 3 seasons of The Carbonaro Effect on Neflix/TruTV, Stayed up all night in an Emergency room for weeks on end for the Lifetime docuseries Chicago ER, and flipped houses for two season on HGTV's windy city rehab A half dozen shows for the travel channel.
                </span></li>
                <li>Take Aways: <span class="project-bullet">A large facet of what i learned was how to troubleshoot complex technical problems under high stress specifically with live news hits, a even greater take away was the softskills of managing client expectations bidding jobs with the proper amount of gear to do the job well but stay in budget. Audio work also allowed me to travel a lot in my twenties and get a much more broad slice of life and culture than I would have working on my own projects alone.</span></li>
