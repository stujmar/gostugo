                <li>The Project: <span class="project-bullet">Puzzle Truck is a 3 dimensional wooden puzzle that assembles into a working pull toy.</span></li>
                <li>My Role: <span class="project-bullet">My friend James Kitia had come to me with the idea of somehow making a toy truck for his kids. It was over many years of design and iteration as well as going throught the Rogers Park Business Alliances Grow program, a small buiness incubator, that we have a finished product worthy of story shelves. By this time his kids had aged out of the toy. While the puzzle truck isn't currently in production it is still on the back burner of my mind.</span></li>
                <li>Take Aways: <span class="project-bullet">I learned a lot about design and iteration as well as coloboarting and making compromises. We had trying to patent the Puzzle truck learning a lot about design patents vs utility patents and patenting vs copywrights.</span></li>
