Aside from running my own service business, I helped other entrepreneurs as they prototyped products and brought their ideas to market. In addition to fabrication services, Edgewater Workbench supported the local creative community, hosting weekly drink and draws, monthly community repair clinics, and after school programming for high school students.</span></li>

                      <li>My Role: <span class="project-bullet">My friend James Kitia came to me with the idea of making a toy truck for his kids based on toys he made as a child in Tanzania. Using my lasercutter, we spent years on iterative design and prototyping to developed a finished prodcut worthy of store shelves. James and I also went through the Rogers Park Business Alliance's small business incubator program to help develop a scalable business plan. While the Puzzle Truck isn't currently in production, it remains on the back burner of my mind.</span></li>
                      <li>Takeaways: <span class="project-bullet">I learned a lot about design and iteration, as well as collaborating and making compromises. We also explored obtaining a patent on the Puzzle Truck, which taught me about design patents vs. utility patents and patenting vs. copywriting.</span> </li>
