                <li>The Project: <span class="project-bullet">Villain of Dirt is an animated concept that became a three-part stopmotion series.</span></li>
                <li>My Role: <span class="project-bullet">I wrote this story as part of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). It was a feature/novel length story that I imagined playing out in stopmotion animation. It ended up being some proof of concept tests consisting of three minute-and-a-half shorts.</span></li>
                <li>Takeaways: <span class="project-bullet">This project was when I started utilizing 3D printing to make molds, or to post-process and finish prints and make casts of them. It was also the first time I used with motion-controlled camera movement in stopmotion animation. It was a fun environment to make mistakes and learn, which led to some commercial work, including Glade Candles, WeatherTech mats, and Hershey's Cookies 'N' Creme candy bars!</span></li>
