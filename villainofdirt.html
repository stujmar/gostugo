                <li>The Project: <span class="project-bullet">Villain of Dirt was an animated concept that ended up being a 3 part stopmotion series.</span></li>
                <li>My Role: <span class="project-bullet">I wrote this story as part of a nation novel writing month event it was a feature/novel length story that I imagined playing out in stopmotion animation. It ended up being some proof of concept tests consisting of three minute and a half shorts.</span></li>
                <li>Take Aways: <span class="project-bullet">This was really when I started utilizing 3d printing to make molds or to post process and finish prints and makes casts of them. As well as work with motion controlled camera movement in stopmotion animation. It was a fun environment to make mistakes and learn, which led to some stopmotion commercial work including Glade Candles weather tech floor mats and Hershey's cookies and cream candy bars!</span></li>
